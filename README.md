# COMPARISON-OF-HUMAN-AND-NON-HUMAN-DRIVERS-IN-SIMPLE-TRAFFIC-MANEUVERS
This project is the class project of Bilkent University Automative Engineering course (ME440) about modelling different types human drivers and nonhuman drivers in the MATLAB/Simulink environment and comparing results based on their reaction time and error amounts. In this project,  human drivers and a PID controller was compared in horizontal s-maneuver in a traffic situation. Vehicle dynamics and different controllers (humans and PID) are created in the MATLAB/Simulink environment.

First run the transfer_function.m script to create the necessary transfer functions in the workspace. Then run the main_model.slx Simulink model, by selecting proper driver (controller), the selection processs is described in the model. Each time you run the main_model.slx, run the graph_plotter afterwards, i.e. in this model there are 4 types of drivers so run in the following order: main_model.slx(driver-type1)->graph_plotter.m->main_model.slx(driver-type2)->graph_plotter.m->main_model.slx(driver-type3)->graph_plotter.m->main_model.slx(driver-type4)->graph_plotter.m). Then at the end of this process, all necessary graphs will be created. 

P.S: All scripts and model was created in the MATLAB/Simulink version R2020a, previous versions might not work. Last Update: 1/17/2021
